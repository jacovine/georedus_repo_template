## Overview

This repository provides a reproducible pipeline for processing, [geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_geocoding), and classifying [CNPJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNPJ)s from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service ([RFB](https://www.gov.br/receitafederal/)) using the [Locais-Nova](https://doi.org/10.1590/S2237-96222025v34.20240361.en) scale.


The report is available [here](https://cem-usp.github.io/locais-nova-rfb-geocoding/).

## Data Availability

[![OSF DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSF-10.17605/OSF.IO/2X6JB-1284C5.svg)](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2X6JB)

The processed data are available in [`csv`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [`rds`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/readRDS.html) and [`parquet`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Parquet) formats through a dedicated repository on the Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/)). A metadata file is included alongside the validated datasets.

Because the classification table are not publicly available, only authorized personnel can access the processed files. They are protected with [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem) 4096-bit encryption ([OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)) and a 32-byte password to ensure data security.

If you already have access to the OSF repository and the project keys, click [here](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2X6JB) to access the data. You can also retrieve these files directly from [R](https://www.r-project.org/) using the [`osfr`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osfr/) package.

## Usage

The pipeline was developed using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system, along with the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) programming languages. To ensure consistent results, the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package is used to manage and restore the R environment.

Access to the raw data is restricted. Running the analyses requires an active internet connection and a set of access keys (see the [*Keys*](#keys) section). Do not use VPNs, corporate proxies, or other network-routing tools while processing the data, as these can interfere with authentication and downloads.

Make sure the AWK executable directory is added to your [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) environment variable.

After installing the four dependencies mentioned above and setting all the keys, follow these steps to reproduce the analyses:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open** the project in your preferred IDE.
3. **Restore the R environment** by running `Sys.setenv(LIBARROW_MINIMAL = "false")` and [`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/restore.html) in the R console. This will install all required software dependencies.
4. **Open** `index.qmd` and run the code as described in the report.

## Keys

To access the data and run the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) notebook, you must first obtain authorization to access the project's [OSF](https://osf.io) repositories and [Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/) files.

Once you have the necessary permissions, run the following command to authorize your access to the Google Sheets API:

```r
library(gargle)
library(googlesheets4)

options(gargle_oauth_cache = ".secrets")

gs4_auth()
gargle_oauth_cache()
```

Next, create a file named [`.Renviron`](https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/set-up.html#:~:text=2.4.6%20The%20.Renviron%20file) in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

- `OSF_PAT`: Your [OSF](https://osf.io/) Personal Access Token ([PAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_access_token)). If you don't have one, go to the settings section of your OSF account and create a new token.
- `ACESSOSAN_PASSWORD`: The password for the project's [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem) private key (32 bytes).

Example (do not use these values):

```ini
OSF_PAT=bWHtQBmdeMvZXDv2R4twdNLjmakjLUZr4t72ouAbNjwycGtDzfm3gjz4ChYXwbBaBVJxJR
ACESSOSAN_PASSWORD=MmXN_od_pe*RdHgfKTaKiXdV7KD2qPzW
```

Additionally, you will need the following keys in the project's [`_ssh`](_ssh) folder:

- `id_rsa`: The project's private RSA key ([RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem) 4096 bits (OpenSSL)).
- `id_rsa.pub`: The project's public RSA key.

These project's keys are provided to authorized personnel only. If you need access, please contact the authors.

## Known Issues

### Arrow Dependencies

```
Error in `dplyr::compute()`:
! NotImplemented: Support for codec 'zstd' not built
```

This error occurs when [`arrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/index.html) is missing certain dependencies. To fix it, run:

```r
Sys.setenv(LIBARROW_MINIMAL = "false")
```

Then reinstall the `arrow` package:

```r
install.packages("arrow")
```
